// Polymorphism -- the provision of a single interface to entities of different types 
/* in other words, there is a generic concept of something and this concept can be made 
 * concrete by multiple types. All of them can be used wherever the generic concept is needed 
 */


/* Inheritance -- enables us to create new classes that reuse, extend, and modify
 * the behavior defined in other classes 
 * 
 * the class whose members are inherited is called the base class, and the class that 
 * inherits those members is called derived class
 * 
 * inheritance is an "is-a" kind of relationship
 * 
 * ex structure: public class Cheddar : Ingredient
 * 
 * this is a public class named Cheddar which is inheriting the Ingredient class 
 * 
 * the base class -- contains data and methods common for any ingredient (or just basic implementation) 
 * the derived class -- is specific to the ingredient (cheddar in the ex) - specific implementation 
 * 
 * private methods cannot be inherited 
 * 
 * protected members can be used in the derived classes but they cannot be used outside
