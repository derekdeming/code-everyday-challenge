<h1>Dereks Recipe for the Best Cinnamon Rolls</h1>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<h3>For the dough: </h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
    <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
    <li>3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
    <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 (.25 ounce) package instant yeast</li>
    <li>1/4 cup water</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
</ul>

<h3>For the filling:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup brown sugar, packed</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>1/2 cup butter, softened</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Heat the milk in a small saucepan until it bubbles, then remove from heat. Mix in butter; stir until melted. Let cool until lukewarm.</li>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 1/4 cup flour, sugar, salt and yeast; stir well. Add water, egg and the milk mixture; beat well. Add the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring well after each addition. When the dough has just pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix together brown sugar, cinnamon, softened butter.</li>
    <li>Roll out dough into a 12x9 inch rectangle. Spread dough with butter/sugar mixture. Roll up dough and pinch seam to seal. Cut into 12 equal size rolls and place cut side up in 12 lightly greased muffin cups. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until browned. Remove from muffin cups to cool. Serve warm.</li>
